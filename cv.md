## About Myself
I'm a person of action with analytical mindset aiming to manage continuous improvement in any environment.

I graduated from BSEU and worked for 6 years as an economist in finance. Well, at a certain point, I became bored and uninterested in developing further in this area. 
I also studied for two years as a graphic artist and was engaged in digital painting.

And now I decided to try myself as a *developer*. 
This occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth, besides there’s a huge 
amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.
I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of 
becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
